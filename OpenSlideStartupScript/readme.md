## Startup Script for Installing Openslide in a Kernel Instance

To set up the startup script which installs openslide for python,
follow the link above IN DETAIL. 

Keep in mind that once you have completed the process for making
the startup script accessible to any one user (Adin did this
for everyone once) they may not be able to select the startup
script from the launcher, and only able to select it from the 
kernel selection menu in the file viewer for an existing notebook

Please ask Adin if you have any questions!
